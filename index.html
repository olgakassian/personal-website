        <h4>MY STORY</h4>
        <p>
          Born in Ukraine and raised in Portugal, I'm an entrepreneur focused on
          projects with an ethical and sustainable background and an advocate
          for responsible businesses. <br />
          At 19 years old I moved to NYC for an adventure in the fashion
          business, then finished an Engineering Degree in Portugal and founded
          my first company at 22 years old.
